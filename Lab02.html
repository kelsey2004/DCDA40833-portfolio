            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> I explored two platfroms that represent two rapidly evolving areas of AI, <strong>audio editing and video generation</strong>. These are tools that directly intersect with my own interests of media production and digital culture. Through my exploration, I looked at how these tools might help support my creative work, but also how they challenge traditional ideas of authorship and labor.</p>

            <h2>Tool 1: Adobe Podcasts</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Last semester I produced my own podcast and learned how time consuming audio editing can be. I uploaded my podcast trailer, about a minute and a half long, and within two minutes it generated an “Audiogram,” a video with text on screen. It kept up well with my speaking pace and highlighted each word accurately. I also tested the transcription feature, which captured my speech clearly. The preview broke the text into readable sections, but when exported, the transcript became one long paragraph. Even after adjusting spacing, the result stayed the same. This is not an ideal format for scripts since it makes it harder for the speaker/ editor to refer to when trying to record a pick-up or make a trim.  </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Adobe Podcast works well for creating short promotional videos with text, especially since you can format them in landscape or portrait, making it flexible. Premium users can customize templates and designs. However, it’s not ideal for generating clean, script ready transcripts, especially for longer audio files.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>A key concern is ownership of creative work. You can record audio directly on the site, but downloading the original file requires a premium subscription. Since users upload their own creative content, it raises questions about how AI generated promotional materials or automated editing affect creative labor and authorship.</p>

            <h2>Tool 2: Pika</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>The second tool I tried was Pika, a video generation platform. I'm not very experienced with describing visuals for AI, but even with broad prompts, it captured parts of what I imagined. For my first attempt I asked for a sun exploding/end of the world simulation. It generated an explosion, but not from the sun and not large enough to feel “world ending.”  Even when I added more details, it still didn't match the scale I envisioned nor were any of the subjects in the video concerned there was an explosion happening. I also tested “Pikaformance,” which creates a video from an uploaded image and audio. I used a casual photo of myself (not a flattering one) and my podcast trailer audio. The result looked surprisingly natural, with no distortion to my face or background, almost as if I had filmed straight from my laptop.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>There are features like Pikascenes, where you can generate a scene using your characters, objects, and locations or Pikaswap which allows users to build scenes or replace objects and characters. Its useful for creative content generation. I can see it helping filmakers visualize ideas or pitch concepts to investors. However, relying on Pika to replace human storytelling, editing, or cinematography would be a poor use of the tool.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>AI generated video carries risks of misuse, including creating misleading, harmful, or non consensual content. Pika's FAQ does not clearly outlined prohibited uses, which leads me to assume anything can be up for generation.</p>

                <figcaption>This is the original image I imputed for pikaformance. I purposefully chose this random image of myself to see if would have an issue if subject is not looking straight at the camera or in the center. </figcaption>

                <figcaption> When using Pikaformance, you upload an image of a subject and the audio you choose. I chose myself and a snippet of my podcast trailer to see what it would look like if my audio had a visual to accompany it.</figcaption>

                <figcaption> Pika outputted a video that was a similar resolution as the orignal image, not distorting the words in the background or myself.</figcaption>

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>As a creative person aiming for a creative career, I see AI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement. I would use it to brainstorm, clarify concepts, or organize research, but not to generate full assignments or make core creative decisions for me. AI can speed up repetitive tasks, but I still want to maintain control over the creative choices that define my work.</p>
        
            <p>AI tools can enhance workflow by helping fix small coding issues or explaining concepts more clearly. They offer an additional resource when troubleshooting or learning new skills. Exploring AI also helps students understand and critique emerging technologies and their cultural impact. However, overreliance can prevent the development of foundational skills and confidence. Despite this, what remains human is the interpersonal connection and interpretation of data. Learning and being under the guidance of someone who's had experience within the field who you can ask for advice or have those discussions on our ever-changing digital culture. Our data can be output using AI, but it cannot interpret it because only humans decide what matters and how to make meaning out of the data.</p>

            <p>When evaluating new AI tools, we should ask how transparent the company is about data use and model limitations. No AI system is neutral. Each reflect the biases of its developers and training data. It's important to understand what information the tool collects, whether it uses user data for training, and whether the company communicates these policies clearly for non technical users.</p>
