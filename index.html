            <p>Welcome to my Portfolio. This site showcases the work I've completed throughout my final semester, demonstrating my growth in digital culture and data analytics.</p>
            <p>In here you'll find work building from foundational web development skills to data visualization and interactive mapping. By the end of the semester, my goal is to present a cohesive collection that reflects both my technical progress and my interests.</p>
        <!--I seperated this short message from my welcome message and wrote it in bold as a design choice so It stands out.-->

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!--This section holds the introduction to who I am. My introduction is what will reflect in the rest my work going forward so I wrote my introduction to reflect how my major and minor interests correlate-->
            <!--As a design choice I wrote my major and minor in bold so It stands out immediately.-->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> My name is Kelsey Sanchez and a fun fact about me is that I am left handed. I am a senior at Texas Christian University majoring in <Strong>Film & Television</Strong> with a minor in <strong>Digital Culture & Data Analytics.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I am passionate about making an impact in society and for my community. Since I was young, I spent majority of my alone time consuming different films and television shows.I have always been fascinated with how visual media could transport or transform us into another world but grew even more interested in what happens behind the scenes. The amount of time, effort, and people it takes to produce just one project. Additonally,I've always found it interesting the cultural impact different media has on our society and I enjoy being apart of the discussions. I enjoy being creative and like to film and edit in my free time.
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> I look forward to developing a portfolio piece that reflects both my artistic voice and my analytical thinking. Overall, becoming more confident in my analytical tools.

            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> It was challenging learning how to navigate visual studio code as I have never worked in it before or with HTML. I refered back to the EDITING and README guides so that I made sure I was working in the correct sections. </p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> [How did your understanding of digital culture and data analytics evolve?]</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> [How will you apply these skills in the future?]</p>
