            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>The artistic data visualization titled “Brainwave Visualizer” aims to bring neuroscience to life, showcasing how our brains respond to visual media in real time.  The interactive dashboard features a handful of videos related to Formula 1 and its drivers, each one with its own personal visualization. It uses color coded brain area metrics such as attention, connection, encoding, immersion, and cognitive load. Through its artistic interpretation/ artistic approach, the data is enhanced and engaging due to its design. You have the option to choose from different videos. Within the categories, you can specifically click to track only one, two, or have all the categories show up on the line chart. You can also easily click on a high or low point and go to that section of the video. I think this is a nice way to present something that has to do with media. By having the videos, we can clearly visualize what the brain was reacting to. It highlights the time-based tracking element of the data much better than if we only have to read a chart. It purposefully is designed to look like brain scan, allowing the categories to shine in high contrast compared to the dark background. The chart is not just displaying lines going up and down, but trying to match the illusion of brain waves. Within this data visualization, I enjoy that the data is colorful and fun, yet kept to a minimum, allowing the numbers to be the focus. Its looks so high-tech and professional that it takes advantage of our trust. Because anything science-related is often already trusted by audiences, this data is perceived as credible, but nowhere on the main dashboard does it inform us where the data comes from or what these numbers mean. This can potentially be misleading. </p>

            <p></p>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>I believe one could come up with a basic interpretation, but it leans more into being abstract. It has universal keys that signal that this is demonstrating how our brain reacts, even without reading the small paragraph associated with it. To start with, the brain icon signals that this has to do with mental activity. In addition to this, the colors associated with the categories are the same ones on the line graph which make it easier to recognize. The timeframe of the line chart, moving up or down, aligns with a timeframe of the video itself, showcasing a relationship, leading to the impression that we are tracking something. </p>

            <p>On the other hand, one might struggle because neuroscience requires special knowledge. When talking about brain activity, yes, one might be able to piece together what “attention” and “connection” mean in relation to brain activity, but other terms like “Immersion,” “Cognitive Load,” or “Encoding” is language specifically tied to those in the field. I personally had to look up the meaning of these terms. Additionally, if you don't know how to read brainwaves, there's no way of knowing what the positive and negative numbers mean. I personally associate positive as good and negative as bad because that's how I've been taught to interpret other line charts. I still don't quite understand the meaning or how to confidently interpret them in this data visualization even after doing some research. </p>
            
            <h3>Context & Completeness</h3>
            <p>There is a short paragraph explaining what the data visualization features, such as “video playback with real-time brain activity” and its intention which is to “showcase how our brains respond to media,” but there is no interpretation of the data or any explanation of why this data matters, maybe it has no true meaning, just a cool visualization, but I would've liked an explanation, especially as an audience member with a non-scientific background. For example, going back to the line graph, traditionally we have been taught to read that if the line goes down, that means decline while when the line goes up it represents progress, but in this context, does it have any other meaning?</p>
            
            <p>Another issue is that you truly don't know where this data comes from. They state it's “…based on data collected from diverse audience groups.” What is considered “diverse” in this context? In the visualization the only other clue we get is that this group is 18 years and older. I would've liked to know if these people were all Formula 1 fans, Are they from different parts of the world?  How many people participated? Were more men or women asked to participate?  I think all of these have the potential to influence the outcome of the data presented. We are left to only hope that they surveyed equally.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The visualization synchronizes a video with real-time brain activity, tracking the responses moment-by-moment and providing this data in line graph format. In terms of how well it translates, at the bare minimum, one might come to a basic interpretation of what is going on, but it struggles to present this data in a way that can be read by everyone and trusted. </p>
