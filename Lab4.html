            <h2>Reflection & Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <p>To start, data preparation went smoothly. I did not encounter any issues when uploading my dataset into Tableau. Because the dataset I chose was already well-formatted, the data set was easily recognized by Tableau and did not require any additional cleaning or formatting.</p>

            <h3>Design Choices</h3>
            <p>To begin, I chose to visualize the performance of all films in a horizontal bar chart from <em>Iron Man (2008)</em> to the latest film, <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)</em> and organized it in descending order in terms of their worldwide box office revenue. Since some films have longer titles than others, it makes it harder to read the release date. I chose the release date as information you can read when you hover over the colored bar chart for easier readability. </p>

            <p>Another metric for determining a film's success is by comparing its production budget and domestic or worldwide box office revenue. A film typically has to make 2.5 times its production budget to at least break even. I chose to visualize the production budget and the worldwide box office performance of each film using a horizontal bar chart with each of these being on the x-axis and the value on the Y-axis. By placing them side by side, one can immediately see how they compare. At the top are the movie titles, but because all 27 films are in the visualization,I made an option to filter the films to allow for easier visualization such as comparing the success of a specific superhero like all three <em>Iron Man</em> films.
</p>
            <p>The third visualization I chose was the film's ratings, using the audience score and tomato meter. The audience score is a score that represents the percentage of users who rated the film positively, while the tomato meter is a score that represents the percentage of critics who rated the film positively. I created this dual axis plot graph that showcases the tomato meter values on the left side and the audience score values on the right side, each measure being a different color to tell them apart on the chart. I chose to use the domestic box office revenue because it is a more direct metric for analyzing ratings, eliminating any variables that may come with an international release . Each film can be filtered as well. 
</p>
            <h3>Expected Patterns</h3>
            <p>As a fan of the franchise, I am not the only one who has noticed the decrease in quality content from Marvel. They seem to prioritize quantity over quality recently, releasing multiple films in such a short span since the end of <em>Avengers: Endgame (2019)</em> and TV series on Disney+. There's definitely an abundance of content, but it doesn't necessarily mean each superhero is given the same amount of quality storytelling. I fully expected <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> to be one of the most successful films in the franchise, if not, the most successful just because it was hyped up by both Marvel and the fans. It was described as a sequel to <em>Avengers: Infinity War (2018)</em>. It's the longest movieof the franchise with 117 minutes, leaving suspense as to how the conflict would be resolved.
</p>
            <p>Based on these visualizations, the box office performance, budget v. grossing, and ratings, <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> was one of the most successful in the franchise. It had high ratings to go with its domestic box office performance which I would deem a quality film. Of course, just because a film is high grossing doesn't necessarily mean it will have high ratings, especially when the franchise has established a dedicated fanbase. But with the belief by many that Marvel has gone downhill since 2019, I expected films released after 2019 to perhaps be on the lower side of the audience/ tomato score, majority like <em>Shang-Chi: The Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)</em>, and <em>Black Widow (2021)</em> were all rated highly from both audiences and critics.</p>

            <h3>Suprises/Outliers</h3>
            <p>However, focusing on the film ratings there were two outliers, the films <em>Captain Marvel (2019)</em> and <em>Eternals(2021)</em>. <em>Captain Marvel</em> grossed $426 million but received a 79% by its tomato critics and a 45% by audiences, placing it at the lower end of the graph. It has the lowest audience score out of the films.  It managed to break even at least through its worldwide revenue, but I would assume that since this takes place during the “peak” marvel years, its ratings would be higher coming from fans. <em>Eternals (2021)</em> on the other hand grossed $164.8 million domestically but received 40% by tomato critics and 78% by audiences. This film has the lowest critic score out of all the films. It has not broken even, not through domestic nor worldwide revenue. I knew that it wasn't a fan favorite of many, but I thought that the majority of the criticism would come from critics not audiences.</p>

            <h3>Questions for Further Investigation</h3>
            <p>Seeing these outliers are from 2019 and 2021, I would like to learn and understand if the pandemic that happened in 2020 played a role in their box office performance or storytelling. Were the films not marketed the same? Was there some underlying misogyny for <em>Captain Marvel</em>? Given the fact that this was the first female stand-alone film in the franchise. Or did the shift in storytelling in <em>Eternals</em> have an impact? Critics did not perhaps know how to understand this departure from the traditional self-made superhero. 
</p>

            <h3>Tool Evaluation</h3>
            <p>I rarely have opportunity to create data visualization for other classes, so I can't accurately compare it to others, but you can customize your graphs more on Tableu than on Canva. While you have the option to import files, I've only had to do simple bar charts so I just manually type in my data. Canva has the basic graphs like bar charts, line graphs, and variety of flow diagrams but I think its graphs are more suited for text visualization. Its very limited compared to what Tableau has to offer. After exploring with Tableau Public, I enjoyed how it automatically separates your categorial data and your numerical data and that it is color-coded to distinguish them easier. I also found it useful that you can change your data from dimension, attribute or measure.  It has so many graphs that I didn't even know were possible. The “show me” feature that gives recommendations and showcases other possibilities for visualization came in handy because I did not always have the best visualization in mind when it came to creating graphs. One limitation that I encountered was with the previous dataset I chose. It was Netflix related, having to do with Tv shows and movies on the platform, but majority of the data was text. I imported it but had trouble visualizing it because of the lack of numerical data. I thought I could work with it but had trouble getting any of my graphs to make sense, so I had to find a different dataset that was more numerical to be able to create visualizations.</p>
